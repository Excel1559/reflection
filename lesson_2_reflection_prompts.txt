What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initiate a repository you are adding the git metadata to that directory, it adds the hidden .git file that you can see using ls -a. this doesn’t make your first commit though, you must do that yourself. Running git status allows you to see what has changed since you have made your last commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area allows you to commit more than one file at a time. The working directory is just the place where all the files in a folder are contained and the repository is where the files are added to after they have been committed.
