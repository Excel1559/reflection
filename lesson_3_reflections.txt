When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I need to collabrate with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because the changes you made me cause errors or may not be complete yet. It makes more sense only pull when something is complete or wont cause a bug in the program.
